You can't take pull twice into the ocean. Why not? I want to drift in the water. They're dangerous. How is the dangerous just to float there? The waves could flip you over. I know how to swim. If the tide is strong, it could pull you out to see. That's on scary.  It is. It'll be difficult to pull you back. I understand. I'll leave the poor toys in my car. That's a good idea. Thank you for the explanation. Why are you bringing the map? I don't want to get lost on our hike. We won't. I have a GPS. There's not always signal in the mountains. Maps aren't accurate as GPS. We don't always have to use the map. Why bring it then?  Like I said, it's just a safety tool. I think it's just more weight in our backpack. Better safe than sorry. I can't argue with that. Let's go in.
